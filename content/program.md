### Tool Showcase

There will be a Tool Showcase session on 16 October, for which we call for tool presentations. We encourage all developers of RV-related tools to present their software (independently of whether or not they have a paper accepted at RV'24). Tables and poster stands will be provided. To register for presentation, please send an email to [rv2024@easychair.org]() with the name(s) of the presenter(s) and of the tool.
