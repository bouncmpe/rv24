**The conference will be held at Demir Demirgil Hall, located in the South Campus of Boğaziçi University.**

In 1863, on a hill overlooking the Bosphorus near Rumeli Fortress, what is now Boğaziçi University was founded as Robert College. It was the first American college established outside the United States with the permission granted by Sultan Abdulaziz. In 1971, Robert College was restructured as a public university, Boğaziçi University, and it continues to be one of Turkey's most prestigious institutions of higher learning.
