## Distributed Runtime Verification with Imperfect Monitors: Challenges and Opportunities

By Borzoo Bonakdarpour

### Abstract 
Monitoring distributed applications that do not share a global clock is highly challenging as the monitor has to potentially deal with a combinatorial enumeration at run time. We also have every reason to believe that distributed monitors are not necessarily perfect and monitors are subject to all types of faults that normal distributed processes are. In this talk, I will present our results on runtime verification of distributed systems and discuss a landscape of solved and open problems for different models of distributed computation. I will also discuss real-world case studies and demonstrate that scalable online monitoring of distributed applications is within our reach.
