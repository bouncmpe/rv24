This edition is the 24th in the series of RV conferences and we return back to Istanbul after 2012. 

- We encompass **theory**, **practical implementations**, and **case studies** in industry as usual.
- We continue to expand into the runtime verification of **learning-enabled systems** and **control** more and more.

This year the beautiful campus of Boğaziçi University will host renowned runtime verification researchers and students from all around world!
