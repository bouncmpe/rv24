## Objectives and Scope

Runtime verification is concerned with the monitoring and analysis of the runtime behavior of software, hardware, and cyber-physical systems. Runtime verification techniques are crucial for system correctness, reliability, and robustness; they provide an additional level of rigor and effectiveness compared to conventional testing and are generally more practical than exhaustive formal verification. Runtime verification can be used prior to deployment for testing, verification, and debugging purposes, and after deployment for ensuring reliability, safety, and security and for providing fault containment and recovery as well as online system repair. Application areas of runtime verification include safety/mission-critical systems, enterprise and systems software, cloud and IoT systems, control systems, health management and diagnosis, and system security and privacy.

The topics of the conference include, but are not limited to:
- specification languages for monitoring
- formal requirements elicitation, specification mining, and machine learning over runtime traces
- monitor construction techniques
- program instrumentation
- combination of static and dynamic analysis
- dynamic type checking and assurance cases
- monitoring techniques for concurrent and distributed systems
- runtime checking of privacy and security policies
- metrics and statistical information gathering
- fault localization, containment, resilience, recovery and repair
- monitoring of systems with learning-enabled components, including reinforcement learning
- runtime verification for autonomy and runtime assurance

**New areas** we are soliciting this year include:
- integrating the results of runtime monitoring with downstream tasks, especially metareasoning, control, fault recovery, and design modifications 
- case studies of using RV in industrial settings, with lessons learned and challenges faced 

Application areas of runtime verification include cyber-physical systems, autonomous systems, safety/mission critical systems, enterprise and systems software, cloud systems, reactive control systems, health management and diagnosis systems, and system security and privacy.

## Papers

Papers can be submitted in one of four categories: regular, short, tool, and benchmark. Every paper will receive at least three reviews.

- **Regular papers** (up to 16 pages, not including references) should present original unpublished results. We welcome theoretical papers, system design papers, papers describing domain-specific variants of RV, and real-world case studies of runtime verification.

- **Short papers** (up to 8 pages, not including references) should present original unpublished ideas but which are not necessarily thoroughly worked out. Examples include emerging RV techniques and applications, “small”-but-useful theoretical results, and techniques and applications that establish relationships between RV and other domains. Papers that present concrete challenges to the application of RV in certain deployments are encouraged as they provide impetus to future research. Position papers can also be suitable if they provide an opportunity for a productive debate at the conference.

- **Tool papers** (up to 8 pages, not including references) should present a new tool or novel extensions to an existing tool supporting runtime verification. The focus of the paper should be on the tool’s capabilities, areas of application, and selected experimental results illustrating the tool’s abilities and possible limitations. The paper must include information on tool availability (e.g. open source at a provided URL or commercial), maturity, and a link to a website containing the theoretical background, a user guide, and a tool download link (if applicable). We strongly encourage authors to make their tools and benchmarks available with their submissions. Presentations for accepted tool papers should contain a demonstration of the tool itself. 

- **Benchmark papers** (up to 8 pages, not including references) should describe a benchmark or benchmark generator useful for evaluating RV tools. Benchmark papers must be accompanied by an easily accessible and usable benchmark submission. The paper should describe the benchmark and its purpose, its domain, how to obtain it and use it, an argument for its usefulness to the broader RV community, and include selected results produced using the benchmark, if any. We are interested in both benchmarks from real-world scenarios and those containing synthetic data designed to achieve interesting properties. Broader definitions of benchmarks e.g. for generating specifications from data or diagnosing faults are within scope. We encourage benchmarks that are tool-agnostic, especially if they have been used to evaluate multiple tools. We also welcome benchmarks that contain verdict labels with rigorous arguments for the correctness of these verdicts, and benchmarks that are demonstrably challenging with respect to the state-of-the-art tools. 

## Best Paper Award

The Program Committee will give a Springer-sponsored Best Paper Award to an elected regular paper.

## Special Journal Issue

The Program Committee will invite a selection of accepted papers to submit extended versions to a special journal issue, which will appear in the [International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer (STTT)](https://link.springer.com/journal/10009).

## Tutorials 

Tutorials are two-to-three-hour presentations on a selected topic. A tutorial proposal is at most 2 pages, and must describe the subject and outline of the tutorial, relevance to RV community, schedule in some detail, and brief biographies of the presenters. 

Tutorial proposers also have the _option_ to submit a Regular Paper (up to 16 pages) on the subject of the tutorial, which will undergo the usual review process. Submission of a regular paper is not required for giving a tutorial at the conference. A tutorial paper’s title must start with "Tutorial:". E.g. "Tutorial: How to RV in an RV".
The deadline for tutorial papers and tutorial 2-page proposals is the same as that for regular papers. 


## Submissions

{{< alert color="danger" >}}

**Double Blind Review**

This year, submissions will be anonymous and go through a **double blind reviewing** process.

Specifically, submitted papers (in all categories) must adhere to two rules: 
1. Author names and institutions must be omitted
2. References to authors’ own related work should be in the third person (e.g., not "We build on our previous work ..." but rather "We build on the work of ...")

{{< /alert >}}


Authors are asked to submit their papers’ PDF using EasyChair at 
- https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=rv2024 

Submitted papers and tutorials must use Springer LNCS style, see 
- https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines  

The page limitations mentioned above include all text and figures, but exclude references. Authors can include a clearly marked appendix exceeding the 16 pages, but this will be reviewed at the discretion of reviewers, and will not be included in the proceedings. This appendix must follow the References and be no longer than 4 pages.

At least one author of each accepted paper must register and present the contribution at RV 2024.

All papers will appear in the conference proceedings in an LNCS volume. Springer encourages authors to include their [ORCIDs](https://www.springer.com/gp/authors-editors/orcid) in their papers. The volume will appear in the LNCS [Formal Methods subline](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/societies-and-lncs/formal-methods-/10627874).
